# Password Strength Checker
## Description
  This is a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria, including length, complexity, uniqueness, entropy, and cracking time. The project aims to provide a simple and effective way to assess the strength of passwords and encourage users to create stronger, more secure passwords.

## Features
1. Checks password length and ensures it meets a minimum threshold of 8 characters
2. Evaluates password complexity by checking for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters
3. Checks for common passwords and warns users if their password is too common
4. Calculates password entropy and warns users if it's too low
5. Estimates password cracking time and warns users if it's too short
6. Provides feedback to users on how to improve their password strength

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Run the password_strength_checker.py script using Python (e.g., python password_strength_checker.py)
3. Enter a password when prompted, and the script will evaluate its strength and provide feedback

## Technical Details
1. Written in Python 
2. Uses the hashlib library for password hashing
3. Uses the math library for entropy calculations
3. Uses a simple cracking time estimation algorithm based on password length
